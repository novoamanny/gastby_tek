- text: SOMETHING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT
  text2: null
  text3: As you’d expect, interest in TEK® roofing products is skyrocketing and more homeowners are taking advantage of this opportunity each day. As they learn more of the details, they realize how crazy it would be to miss out on this great investment. Metal roofing by its nature endures better than any other solution. The homeowners’ insurance company should be able to offer them a discount on insurance premiums for Class 4 Roofing, an additional savings!
